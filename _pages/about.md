I am Lorraine Yuan, a fifth-year PhD candidate in the [Operations, Technology, and Information Management (OTIM)](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/operations-technology-information-management/) division of SC Johnson College of Business at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karan Girotra](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/karan-girotra/) and [Prof. Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/). I'm also a doctoral fellow at [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu) at Cornell Tech. I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Renmin University of China. I also hold a M.Eng. in Operations Research from Cornell Tech.

My research interests center on **responsible AI adoption, with a particular emphasis on the interplay between data privacy and technology adoption in supply chain networks**. I am passionate about exploring how AI-based technologies can transform the life cycle of data-driven decision-makingâ€”from data collection and privacy protection to the large-scale adoption of these technologies. I develop advanced privatization techniques and explore their applications in inventory management to enhance profitability and customer service while maintaining robust privacy protections. Additionally, I integrate advanced data-driven analytics to assess the impact of emerging technologies like Generative AI within production networks. 

My research methodology combines data-driven optimization, machine learning techniques, network theory, and differential privacy algorithms.
