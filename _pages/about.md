I am Lorraine Yuan, a final year PhD candidate in the [Operations, Technology, and Information Management (OTIM)](https://www.johnson.cornell.edu/programs/phd-program/operations-technology-information-management/) division of SC Johnson College of Business at [Cornell Tech](https://tech.cornell.edu), where I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Karan Girotra](https://tech.cornell.edu/people/karan-girotra/) and [Prof. Elena Belavina](https://sha.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/eb733/). I'm also a doctoral fellow at the [Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu). I obtained a B.S. in Mathematics and a B.A. in Economics from Renmin University of China. I also hold a M.Eng. in Operations Research from Cornell Tech.

My research interests center on **responsible AI adoption**, with a particular emphasis on **privacy in data-driven decision making** and the broader impact of **AI adoption at scale**. 

I develop privacy-preserving data-driven algorithms and explore their impact for adoption at scale in inventory management to enhance profitability maintaining customer privacy. More recently, my work applies computational and statistical methods to design Human-AI copilot strategies for agentic AI within production networks. 

### Research Interests

**Topics**: Data Privacy, Generative AI Adoption, Inventory Management, Mechanism Design
**Methodologies**: Data-driven Optimization, Economics Modelling, Differential Privacy


**I am on the 2025-2026 job market**.
